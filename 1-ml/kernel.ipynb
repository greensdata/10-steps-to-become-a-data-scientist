    "1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.\n",

    "4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).\n",
    "\n",

    "The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a **multivariate data set** introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers in three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\".\n",
    "The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n",
